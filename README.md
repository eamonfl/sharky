Sharky is my first attempt at creating some public code
It is a tool to either:
1. Read a PCAP file.
2. Read from a network interface.

Its not meant to be a replace for a Wireshark/Tshark, its just provides a snapshot of the top talkers(first 1,000 packets)

Its uses Streamlit for the Web frontend

Two install
